# Miscellaneous Award Winning Gamejam Games

If you've had a look at the rest of my Github portfolio, you can probably tell that I like making stuff. Especially games. There's something about the medium that combines creativity with a technical edge, allowing for some bonkers creations.

One of my hobbies is taking part in timed gamejams. Although I usually prefer having a large project to treat as my own metaphorical baby, I find the pressure of a gamejam and spur innovation. The relatively short required length of the games, and lack of motive for commercial success, has let me come out with the following acclaimed titles:


## Magnum Opus

Magnum Opus: The final University of Bristol gamejam by Jordan Taylor. Going out with a bang. Winner: Best overall. Theme: It's not a bug it's a feature.

Magnum Opus is a third person, live action, stop-motion horror adventure created in 36 hours for the 2022 CSS Gamejam. It originally featured live processed sound effects on an external modular analogue synth, however the downloadable version is only software based.
Numerous graphical effects were created, including global visual noise spikes, static, and a variant of chromatic abberation.

Sound effects made using foley and the analogue synth.
I broke myself a bit making this.

Winner of Bristol Computer Science 2021 Gamejam People's Choice award.

An on-rails shooter contained completely within powerpoint.

The game originally kept track of a measure of health using macros and VBA scripts, however these had to be removed due to the University's security concerns.
