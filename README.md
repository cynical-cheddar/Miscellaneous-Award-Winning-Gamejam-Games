# Miscellaneous Award Winning Gamejam Games

If you've had a look at the rest of my Github portfolio, you can probably tell that I like making stuff. Especially games. There's something about the medium that combines creativity with a technical edge, allowing for some bonkers creations.

One of my hobbies is taking part in timed gamejams. Although I usually prefer having a large project to treat as my own metaphorical baby, I find the pressure of a gamejam and spur innovation. The relatively short required length of the games, and lack of motive for commercial success, has let me come out with the following acclaimed titles:


## Magnum Opus
![enter image description here](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzEwNTA0MDAxLnBuZw==/original/tjnwFh.png)

Magnum Opus: The final University of Bristol gamejam by Jordan Taylor. Going out with a bang. Winner: Best overall. Theme: It's not a bug it's a feature.

Magnum Opus is a third person, live action, stop-motion horror adventure created in 36 hours for the 2022 CSS Gamejam. It originally featured live processed sound effects on an external modular analogue synth, however the downloadable version is only software based.
Numerous graphical effects were created, including global visual noise spikes, static, and a variant of chromatic abberation.

Sound effects made using foley and the analogue synth.
I broke myself a bit making this.

## GO BACK TO HELL: Death is Just The Beginning

![enter image description here](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzEwNTAzOTg1LnBuZw==/original/f5Gi2i.png)
Winner of Bristol Computer Science 2021 Gamejam People's Choice award.

An on-rails shooter contained completely within powerpoint.
Naturally, this game had a very out-of-left-field development and development style.

While not one of the most traditionally technical games I've made, I don't think anyone could ask for more Microsoft Office proficiency.

The game originally kept track of a measure of health using macros and VBA scripts, however these had to be removed due to the University's security concerns.

## Flash Gordon: Race For Ajax
![enter image description here](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ2MDUzOTgucG5n/original/n3eRdu.png)

Winner of Bristol Computer Science 2020 Gamejam People's Choice award.
This gamejam was completed fully remotely. As such, my motivation for working through the whole 24 hours was rather diminished. Therefore, this game was made with the challenge of fitting development all within an 8 hour work day (plus a little bit of overtime for polish). Paypal were sponsoring 2020's gamejam, and the representative seemed to approve of my working practice - although whether this is reflected in the company's work culture is yet to be seen.

## They Came First (Original)

![enter image description here](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzI3MTI1OTMucG5n/original/LC1yh5.png)
Winner of the 2019 CSS UoB Gamejam - Best Overall. The first of two years I wanted to 'tryhard' at the University Gamejam - the second being for Magnum Opus. 
They Came First is a surreal 3D egg-based horror platformer created by a team of six majorly green and fresh faced students.

I felt the idea and setting had a lot more to explore. As such, this game formed the basis for a much more substantial sequel created in 2020.

(Renamed to Who-Came-First because of the sequel)

## They Came First (Sequel)

![enter image description here](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzMyNzE5NDMucG5n/original/8tGkNS.png)
Winner of the international Scream Machine horror Gamejam (two weeks full time development).

A psychedelic lucid dream horror synthscape…  **where you’re an egg**.

They Came First is an experimental horror game capturing creative use of camera angles, lighting, and glitch effects that, with the use of a heavily synth based sound design, attempts to create an altogether nightmarish machine-scape.

Inspired by the winning concept developed in the 2019 css gamejam – this game is a test bed for the bizarre machinations of a mind in lockdown.

A game by Jordan Taylor.

Original soundtrack by Jack Connor.

Created for the 2020 Scream Machine gamejam.

## Turncoat

![enter image description here](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMzMyOTYzLzE2NDg3ODkucG5n/original/yOAlJv.png)

Trust nobody. Not even your jacket.

A team based arena shooter with a twist. Deceive your foes and work with your allies to lead you to victory!

You are able to change your appearance at will, creating shrouds of secrecy between players.

The making of Turncoat is not exactly an experience I would enjoy re-enacting. It involved the hastily bodged development of a hard-coded client-server based multiplayer game. 

Was it successful? Yes. 

Is it any good? Arguably.

The project was given note for the achievement of creating a multiplayer game in 24 hours, however - in honesty - its graphics and gameplay are lacking.

If you're an employer stumbling across my portfolio, take this as evidence that I'm able to bodge things at ridiculous speeds - I just ask you that you don't make me.

## Super-Nova

![enter image description here](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQyMzE2NjEucG5n/original/E3lt8E.png)

Okay, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Super-Nova is the result of my only entry to any three-hour gamejam. The theme was 'stars'.

Super Nova pits your as the driver of a rocket-powered Vauxhall Nova, violently flying through space as you dash away from a Supernova - hurtling by the suspiciously densely packed planetoids that seek to plunge you to your doom!

I'm a bit cheeky because this game didn't actually win any awards, I just think it's funny.
